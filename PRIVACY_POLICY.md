**Privacy Policy**

This privacy policy applies to the Youamp app (hereby referred to as "Application") for mobile
devices that was created
by Kirill Zhukov (Stersh) (hereby referred to as "Service Provider") as an Open Source service. This
service is intended
for use "AS IS".

**Information Collection and Use**

The Application collects information when you download and use it. This information may include
information such as

* Your device's Internet Protocol address (e.g. IP address)
* The pages of the Application that you visit, the time and date of your visit, the time spent on
  those pages
* The time spent on the Application
* The operating system you use on your mobile device

The Application does not gather precise information about the location of your mobile device.

The Application collects your device's location, which helps the Service Provider determine your
approximate
geographical location and make use of in below ways:

* Geolocation Services: The Service Provider utilizes location data to provide features such as
  personalized content,
  relevant recommendations, and location-based services.
* Analytics and Improvements: Aggregated and anonymized location data helps the Service Provider to
  analyze user
  behavior, identify trends, and improve the overall performance and functionality of the
  Application.
* Third-Party Services: Periodically, the Service Provider may transmit anonymized location data to
  external services.
  These services assist them in enhancing the Application and optimizing their offerings.

The Service Provider may use the information you provided to contact you from time to time to
provide you with important
information, required notices and marketing promotions.

For a better experience, while using the Application, the Service Provider may require you to
provide us with certain
personally identifiable information. The information that the Service Provider request will be
retained by them and used
as described in this privacy policy.

**Third Party Access**

Only aggregated, anonymized data is periodically transmitted to external services to aid the Service
Provider in
improving the Application and their service. The Service Provider may share your information with
third parties in the
ways that are described in this privacy statement.

The Service Provider may disclose User Provided and Automatically Collected Information:
