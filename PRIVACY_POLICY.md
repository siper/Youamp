This privacy policy applies to the Youamp app (hereby referred to as "Application") for mobile devices that was created
by Kirill Zhukov (Stersh) (hereby referred to as "Service Provider") as an Open Source service. This service is intended

The Application collects information when you download and use it. This information may include information such as

* Geolocation Services: The Service Provider utilizes location data to provide features such as personalized content,
  relevant recommendations, and location-based services.

  behavior, identify trends, and improve the overall performance and functionality of the Application.

  These services assist them in enhancing the Application and optimizing their offerings.

The Service Provider may use the information you provided to contact you from time to time to provide you with important

For a better experience, while using the Application, the Service Provider may require you to provide us with certain
personally identifiable information. The information that the Service Provider request will be retained by them and used
as described in this privacy policy.
